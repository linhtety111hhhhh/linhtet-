                such as Shwedagon Pagoda are packed with pilgrims who light candles to pay homage to the Buddha and
                gain merit. Each light adds to the incredible spectacle of thousands of small flames burning in the night. Out
                on the streets, meanwhile, some people light fireworks or launch small hot-air balloons, which silently
                ascend and drift across the sky before burning out.</p>
